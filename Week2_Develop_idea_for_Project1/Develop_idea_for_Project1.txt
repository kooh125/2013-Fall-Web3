Most of the people in this world ought to buy food to fulfill their hunger instead of cooking at home. Same applies to me when I go out for school/work, I tend to buy food from the stores on the street. After the repetition of buying foods outside, I tend to visit popular restaurants and share with my peers. The reason of this idea is because I've been experiencing shortage in money that led me hard to maintain and save. Therefore, I thought about trying to make foods from those popular restaurants at home but the problem I encountered was the time and efficiency of cooking. For the beginner cooks, I would like to present step-by-step guid to cut vegetables, meat, etc.

My first assignment, making responsive web design will focus on "How to cut foods" using CSS, HTML, jQuery and Javascript. I'll be using illustrated images and put some little effects such as rotate, click, etc. It can bring people to feel more friendly while they learn how to cut foods. Illustration can be changed using mouse scroll or changing the size of the browser. I will create one page website design and I'll try to approach parallel web design too. I attached four kind of images that I will be using as main characters for "How to cut food" Website.
